# Building the ubuntu docker image ourselves!

Lets actually build an Ubuntu docker image, instead of using the pre-built one from the hub.

Step 1.
Download the source files with the Dockerfile and dependancies

```
git clone -b dist https://github.com/tianon/docker-brew-ubuntu-core.git

```

Step 2.
cd into the repository, check the Dockerfile is there with `ls`.

```
cd docker-brew-ubuntu-core/xenial
ls .
```

Step 3.
Tell docker to build a new image using the Dockerfile

```
docker build .
```

You'll then see Docker work away building the Ubuntu image.

Once complete, it will be given a random name.

`docker images` command allows you to see all the docker images on your system, including the one you have just built and also the ones you have previously downloaded from hub.

You can identify your new image, it will be the only one that doesn't belong to a repository! use the `IMAGE ID` in the next step.

Run your newly created docker image! You'll see it behaves exactly the same as the ubuntu image we grabbed from the hub as it was built with the same Dockerfile.

```
docker run -ti <your image ID>
```

It should now be pretty obvious how we'd make our own changes to build a custom Docker image.. Lets do that, make something specific for our application needs!

# Building our Custom Cisco Learning Labs Container!

I'm currently sat here at Cisco LIVE! Europe 2017 in the wonderful city of Berlin.. So lets have our custom app say that!

![Custom Docker Output](/posts/files/docker-101/assets/images/hellocustom1.png)

To do this we will

* Create a new Python script.
* Tell our Dockerfile to include the script in our container build
* Also tell our Dockerfile to install python in the container (remember, dependancies all need to be there too!)
* Build and test our new container.

## You have a choice young Jedi.

You can either copy and paste, manually type the next set of commands in OR download the following repo from github where i've written out the files, just clone the repo below into your play-with-docker terminal.

```
git clone https://github.com/matjohn2/container-intro-devnet.git
cd container-intro-devnet
```

We now see two files.
Our 'app', a simple python file which prints our message.

```
#!/usr/bin/env python

print("Hello from DevNET at Cisco LIVE! Europe 2017!")
```

Then, a dockerfile that builds our app container.

```
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get -y install python
ADD hellodevnet.py /hellodevnet.py
CMD ["/hellodevnet.py"]
```

Our Dockerfile says
* `FROM ubuntu`, this EXTENDS the existing ubuntu public docker image, without having to re-build it ourselves each time. (remember the other images used `FROM scratch`, they were not building on any other images)
* `RUN apt-get update`, this make sure the package management tools within our base ubuntu container are ready.
* `RUN apt-get -y install python`, We use apt-get (which is why we wanted our container to be based off the ubuntu one) to install python and all it's dependancies into the container for us.
* `ADD hellodevnet.py /hellodevnet.py`, We add our application python file from the local directory into our container build as `/hellodevnet.py`
* `CMD ["/hellodevnet.py"]`, whenever we run our container, we want it to run our python app.

And thats all there is to it. Lets build our new app container!

```
docker build .
```
![Custom Docker Build](/posts/files/docker-101/assets/images/dockerbuildcustom.png)

Run your new Container! You should see our app run and give you the hello message.

## Congratulations, you've just built and run a custom docker image!

So far though, all our output has been on the command line. Apps that output hello aren't that useful.

Lets continue and build something useful... Like a Webserver!
