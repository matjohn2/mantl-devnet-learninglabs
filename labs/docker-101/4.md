# Building a simple webserver container.

So instead of python echoing a hello message, it can also host a simple webserver, listening for HTTP requests..

The following python command will set this up.

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

So, it should be pretty easy to build a container to do this instead of our echo!

The dockerfile looks like this...

```
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get -y install python
EXPOSE 8000
ENTRYPOINT [“python”, “-m”, “SimpleHTTPServer”, “8000”]
```

The first three lines should be farmiliar, the last two we're introducing new Dockerfile options.

### EXPOSE
Tells Docker this image expects to serve connections on a TCP/IP PORT, otherwise noone would be able to access the webserver running in the container.

### ENTRYPOINT
This is like CMD, only it allows arguments to be passed to the command, we need this as we're passing options `-m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` to the command `python`.

Save this dockerfile in a new directory and build our new webserver container image:

```
docker build .
docker run <your new container id>
```

# Nothing happened?
This is the first time we've run the `docker run` command and seen no output, this is because our app doesn't print anything out to the screen. How do we know it's running properly?

```
docker ps
```

Gives us a list of running containers, we can see our new webserver running.

OK, so how do we access it? By default Docker gives each container an internal IP address on the host. We can find out which one our container has using `docker inspect <container ID>`

This will output much information about our container. You'll find "IPAddress" in this output as shown below.

![Docker Inspect](/posts/files/docker-101/assets/images/dockerinspect.png)

So we know which IP our container is on.. and we know we exposed port 8000.

LETS QUERY OUR WEBSERVER!

i'm using the `curl` command from our play-with-docker terminal. It's a CLI based web browser.. It will do for what we need!

```
curl http://<container IP>:8000
```

By default the webserver will serve the root directory of the container...

### Success!

![Success](/posts/files/docker-101/assets/images/success.png)

And success! We see our containerised webserver giving us the directory listing back.

## Extra credit?
You know how to `ADD` files to our docker build process, so if you wrote a HTML page called `index.html` and added it to the Dockerfile, guess what new webserver container would serve instead of the directory listing?

Give it a try!


# Summary

In this learning lab we have:

* Understood docker images are built using Dockerfiles
* Understood how existing public images are built by viewing their Dockerfiles
* Built and run our own images
* Connected to a webserver running in our custom Docker container.

Give yourselves a pat on the back, grab a coffee and enjoy the suggested labs on the next page.

Thats all folks!
