# The Tools of CI/CD
To build our CI/CD pipeline, we're going to need a few tools and services.

## 1. Git / Code repository
We need somewhere to check our code into for versioning.

Usually, this is github.com, github enterprise, gitlab, gogs, or some other git-based code repository system.

Code repository's can also alert other systems when a change is made (via a webhook), this is what kicks off our CI/CD pipeline.

We'll be using Gogs, a self hosted Git server for this lab.

## CI/CD Server
A CI/CD server allows us to piece together actions for our pipeline such as test code, package code, deploy code with simple "if, then, else" style logic.

Many tools exist in this area, with our favorite being Drone, as it allows all of the actions to be run in docker containers, keeping the CI/CD base system clean.

Others you may have heard of include CircleCI, Concourse, Travis etc.

Jenkins was historically the leader in this space, the difference being that Jenkins had to be setup for each application and codebase manually; newer CI/CD tools like drone read their pipeline configuration from the code repository, allowing the CI/CD configuration to be versioned and managed by the developers.

We'll be using Drone in this lab.

## A Container repository
Where do we put our packaged containers so that we can deploy them somewhere? Docker repositories come in public and private (self hosted) flavours, we'll be using the public http://hub.docker.com.

## A 'Deployment Destination'
Where do we want our pipeline to deploy our new code, any container orchestrator can be configured on a per-codebase (per pipeline) basis, we'll be using Kubernetes as our deployment destination.

# To the Sandbox!
Setting up a kubernetes cluster, gogs server and drone installation would in itself be a learning lab longer than this one!

We care about using these tools to make a CI/CD system, not how they are installed, for that reason, our DEVNET sandbox team has built a CI/CD sandbox, with all the services we need pre-configured for our convenience.

Anyone can reserve a sandbox, free of charge (with a free Devnet login) for upto 7 days.

### 1. Go to the CI/CD sandbox.

[Click here for the CI/CD Sandbox](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/8aa245b0-4e94-456e-bd29-519b3c61937e?diagramType=Topology)

Click "Reserve" and chose your duration, we'll then prepare you your own private environment containing;

- A Linux Workstation
- A Drone Installation
- A Gogs git server
- A full, two node Kubernetes cluster

Once the sandbox is running, you'll receive an e-mail with VPN details. Having a VPN to the sandbox allows us to keep the systems simple and give you full access to the devices, without risking associated abuse should they be internet facing.


### 2. VPN into the CI/CD Sandbox

Details and credentials will be included in the e-mail.

You will then have direct network access to all of the Sandbox services.
