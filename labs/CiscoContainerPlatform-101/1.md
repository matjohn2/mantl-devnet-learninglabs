Cisco Container Platform 101

# Objective

This learning lab will introduce you to the Cisco Container Platform product, it's interface, API's and product benefits.
The lab will use Cisco Container Platform API's to simply create, provision and manage a Kubernetes cluster on the infrastructure you see in front of you.

We will then use your new Kubernetes cluster to deploy a containerised application onto Kubernetes, with storage persistence.

Completion time: 30 minutes

# Audience

* DevOps and SRE engineering teams.
* IT Audiences looking to consume containers.
* IT Audiences needing on-premise or multi-cloud Container API's.
* IT Audience preparing to address their developers need for Docker and Containers.


# What is Cisco Container Platform?
Cisco Container Platform is a NEW product, aimed at making the delivery of an on-premise or multi-cloud container platform as simple as the public cloud user experience.

Specifically;

  - IT teams should not need to specialise in Kubernetes internals to provide Kubernetes services to their development teams.
  - Creation and Maintenance of Kubernetes clusters should be automated and API driven.
  - The end result should be native kubernetes access for the end developers, not custom tooling.
  - The solution should provide validated, previously tested clusters and configurations, with regular releases and updates.

With Cisco Container Platform, your IT teams can tie self-service provisioning of multiple Kubernetes clusters into their existing management tooling; or use the Container Platform UI to create a "Kubernetes as a Service" layer for your Organization, while benefiting from the known-cost and data sovereignty aspects of on-premise workloads.

Also, because Cisco Container Platform produces "Vanilla" Kubernetes clusters, your DevOPS teams can write truly cross-environment automation utilising the Kubernetes API, making the consumption of multiple public and private environments a much less daunting task.

# What is HyperFlex?

As with any "Cloud" provider, API's are the key to solid automation, making self service for multiple users possible.

Cisco Hyperflex brings this concept on-premise, with a single server SKU that clusters to provide scale-out compute, storage and networking in a single product.
Hyperflex servers, powered by Cisco UCS management give a perfect production-tested base on which to build an on-premise Kubernetes as a Service solution, with all the API's needed to allow Cisco Container Platform to manage the creation and updates of your tenant Kubernetes clusters.

HyperFlex storage is also resilient across the servers in the HyperFlex pool, allowing Cisco Container Platform to use this for Kubernetes persistent volumes.

HyperFlex is a topic all of it's own; but knowing that Cisco Container Platform deploys on top of it is all you need here. (Existing HyperFlex users can install Cisco Container Platform directly onto their existing installation, it just Consumes the HyperFlex API's!)

# Lets Dig In!
# 1. A Kubernetes Cluster provisioned by Cisco Cloud Platform...

We said Cisco Cloud Platform provides the API's needed to provide Kubernetes as a Service; This is where we prove it and get you hands on!
You see the HyperFlex cluster in front of you in the middle of the table? That is our DEVNET Cisco Container Platform envionment for CLUS Orlando.

<PICTURE WILL GO HERE ONCE ONSITE!>

When you opened this Learning Lab, we automatically sent an API call to the platform to create you a cluster, for uniqueness, we named it after your DEVNET membership userID.

If you look to the right of this learning lab page, you should see the button pictured below, which will show you the credentials for the cluster that is spinning up. You can create multiple users in Cisco Container Platform and assign them access rights to only certain clusters, this is what we have done here.

## A. Log into Cisco Cloud Platform to view our cluster.

Open [THIS LINK (https://10.254.3.50/)](https://10.254.3.50/) in a new tab to see the Cisco Container Platform UI, you will be able to log in with the credentials provided on the right, below we see a user "1234" logging in.

## B. View your available Clusters.

You should be presented with your very own cluster on the "clusters" screen. It will be in the process of 'PROVISIONING', showing the platform is in the process of building us a new cluster.

DevOps user 1234 logged in:

We can click on the cluster to see details about the current state of the provisioning process, you will see the platform create a Kubernetes master node, and then, once healthy, create worker nodes also. We have told CCP to provision you a cluster with a single master and two workers for this lab.

Don't worry if the details screen doesn't look quite like the example, you have been reading while things have been provisioning in the background.

## C. Cisco Container Platform permissions.

There are two types of access currently in Cisco Container Platform, admin's that can create and view clusters, and "DevOps" users that can only see the clusters they have been assigned; your user is a 'DevOPS' user as this is a shared environment, so you can only see your cluster. You can also not create a new cluster, which is why we've kicked one off for you.

Admin user logged in will see all clusters:

## D. See the underlying infrastructure.

The HyperFlex system uses VMWare VCenter for it's virtual machine management, you can log into the VCenter for this environment with a read only user to see Cisco Container Platform provisioning your underlying VM's and configuration...

Open [THIS LINK (https://10.254.0.21/ui/)](https://10.254.0.21/ui/) in a new tab to see the VSphere UI, and log on with the following details:

Username: learninglab@vsphere.local
Password: labREADONLY1*

You will be able to see Virtual Machines named after your cluster in the right hand column, along with other users clusters and the Cisco Container Platform management VM's themselves, which form a "control Kubernetes cluster" hosting the UI, API, automation and management as well as utilities for future upgrades.

At the bottom of the page, you will also be able to see recent events which Cisco Container Platform is orchestrating, such as here we see a cluster named "1222test" was deleted.

![](/posts/files/CiscoContainerPlatform-101/assets/images/1234user-vsphere-events.png)

You should, by now, see three powered on Virtual Machines for your cluster, a master and your two workers.

# Next Steps!
Our cluster should be well on the way to being ready, lets have a quick look over some of the other features and configuration options of Cisco Container Platform. Click the right arrow to continue!
