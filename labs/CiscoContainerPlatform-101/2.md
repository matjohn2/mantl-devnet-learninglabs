Cisco Container Platform 101

# 2. Provider Settings and VIP Pools

Clicking around the Cisco Cloud Platform UI, you'll notice a menu to the left.
Here, an admin can configure users and groups (including Active Directory login authentication) and define VIP pools.


VIP pools allow an administrator to define a "real" IP range that clusters can use to integrate with the existing IT or Enterprise environment, each cluster is assigned a VIP pool, and Cisco Container Platform will manage allocations of addresses from that pool to each Kubernetes cluster when an "externally" reachable IP is needed, such as a LoadBalancer service.

Notice in the Cluster details page, a VIP has already been assigned to the Master node of your cluster, allowing access to the Kubernetes dashboard from where you're sitting on the DEVNET network at Cisco LIVE! The POD IP addresses used within the cluster are all internal and do not interact with any external networks; these have been configured on 192.168.0.0/16 for your cluster.

# 3. Cisco Container Platform API's

Each Cisco Container platform installation comes with integrated API documentation, powered by Swagger.
You can access this [HERE (https://10.254.3.50:30437/2/swaggerapi/)](https://10.254.3.50:30437/2/swaggerapi/), where you will see all the currently supported API requests.

Click on "List Operations" to expand the subsections, in this Lab, we're going to use the `/2/system` and `/2/clusters` sections, so expand those;

## Authenticate to the API
The swagger UI will remember our authentication token once we use the `/2/system/login` API call, so that all other API's on the swagger page will work.
Use your Cisco Container Platform credentials (from the top right of this page), expand the `/2/system/login` box and enter your username and password, then hit `Try it Out!`.

You should see a response code of 200, if not, check your credentials and try again!

## Query your clusters
We can use the API to query Cisco Container Platform for available clusters, remember we are authenticated with your specific user, so only Clusters you have permission to see will be returned!

Expand the blue "GET" API labelled `/2/clusters` and hit `Try it out!`. Because we are querying for all clusters this API call needs no parameters.

The information we get back is used by the Cisco Cloud Platform UI to show information about our cluster, such as the number of workers and master nodes, as well as the state of the cluster.

We also are given the Cluster's UUID, this can be used for performing API actions against a specific cluster.

Does your API output say `State: READY`?
If so, the Kubernetes cluster has been built, configured and ready to use. The Web UI uses these API's to provide information too, so if you refresh the UI in your browser, you'll see the cluster says "READY" there also.

If you're cluster isn't ready, it will only take another minute or so; good things come to those who wait!
In the meantime, have a look through the rest of the Swagger API documentation, you can see a `POST` to `/2/clusters` documented which would allow an admin user to create a new cluster, allowing Cisco Cloud Platform to be integrated with other workflows or IT tooling an enterprise may have.

When the cluster is `State: READY`, click next to continue!
