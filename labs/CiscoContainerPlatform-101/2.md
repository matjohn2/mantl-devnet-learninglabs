Cisco Container Platform 101

# Provider Settings and VIP Pools

Clicking around the Cisco Cloud Platform UI, you'll notice a menu to the left.
Here, an admin can configure users and groups (including Active Directory login authentication) and define VIP pools.


VIP pools allow an administrator to define a "real" IP range that clusters can use to integrate with the existing IT or Enterprise environment, each cluster is assigned a VIP pool, and Cisco Container Platform will manage allocations of addresses from that pool to each Kubernetes cluster when an "externally" reachable IP is needed, such as a LoadBalancer service.

Notice in the Cluster details page, a VIP has already been assigned to the Master node of your cluster, allowing access to the Kubernetes dashboard from where you're sitting on the DEVNET network at Cisco LIVE! The POD IP addresses used within the cluster are all internal and do not interact with any external networks; these have been configured on 192.168.0.0/16 for your cluster.

# Cisco Container Platform API's

Each Cisco Container platform installation comes with interactie API documentation, powered by Swagger.
You can access this [HERE (https://10.254.3.50:30437/2/swaggerapi/)](https://10.254.3.50:30437/2/swaggerapi/), where you will see all the currently supported API requests.

Click on "List Operations" to expand the subsections, in this Lab, we're going to use the "2/system" and "2/clusters" sections, so expand those;
