## Access Your Kubernetes Cluster, by API or by UI!

If you click on your cluster within the Cisco Cloud Platform UI, you will see a number of buttons at the right hand side. Click on "Download Token", this will provide you a "Kubernetes Environment" file, which provides authentication to access your Kubernetes Cluster.

There is also a button to open the Kubernetes Dashboard UI for your cluster! Click that and see your freshly provisioned Kubernetes cluster!

Wether accessing kubernetes via the dashboard UI, API or `kubectl` CLI, authentication is needed. Choose `Kubeconfig` (default) and select the authentication file you just downloaded.

### Automating cluster access
Continuing the automation, "Kubernetes as a Service" theme, if these credentials and URL's for accessing the cluster are also available via the Cisco Container Platform API.

If you still have the Swagger UI open, you will see an API call labelled `/2/clusters/{clusterUUID}/dashboard`.
Providing the UUID of your cluster to this `GET` request will return the URL of the Kubernetes dashboard. Similarly, `/2/clusters/{clusterUUID}/env` will provide you with the authentication file, which could be used by CI/CD to then automatically deploy workloads onto the new cluster!
