## Access Your Kubernetes Cluster, by API or by UI!

If you click on your cluster within the Cisco Cloud Platform UI, you will see a number of buttons at the right hand side. Click on "Download Token", this will provide you a "Kubernetes Environment" file, which provides authentication to access your Kubernetes Cluster.

There is also a button to open the Kubernetes Dashboard UI for your cluster! Click that and see your freshly provisioned Kubernetes cluster!

Wether accessing kubernetes via the dashboard UI, API or `kubectl` CLI, authentication is needed. Choose `Kubeconfig` (default) and select the authentication file you just downloaded.

Then you will be given access to your clusters Dashboard!

### Automating cluster access
Continuing the automation, "Kubernetes as a Service" theme; these credentials and URL's for accessing the cluster are also available via the Cisco Container Platform API.

If you still have the Swagger UI open, you will see an API call labelled `/2/clusters/{clusterUUID}/dashboard`.
Providing the UUID of your cluster to this `GET` request will return the URL of the Kubernetes dashboard. Similarly, `/2/clusters/{clusterUUID}/env` will provide you with the authentication file, which could be used by CI/CD to then automatically deploy workloads onto the new cluster!

## Deploying an APP on our cluster!
Demo apps are fun, real apps are better!

We're going to use Kubernetes to deploy an installation of "OwnCloud", an open source file synchronisation and sharing webapp, similar to dropbox, google drive, etc.

The deployment is made up of the following Kubernetes objects:
- Deployment / Pods:         The OwnCloud application itself.
- Service / LoadBalancer:    Our real-world IP that will allow us to access the application
- Persistent Volume Claims:  Cisco Container Platform has pre-configured Kubernetes to use HyperFlex storage, giving Kubernetes apps easy access to persistent storage.

The kubernetes deployment manifest for our OwnCloud application is here: [Open me in a new tab and copy the whole page to the clipboard.](/posts/files/CiscoContainerPlatform-101/assets/kube-manifests/owncloud.json)

Using the Kubernetes dashboard UI, we can now deploy this App, click on `Create` at the top right of the Dashboard UI

In the black field that opens, paste the entire JSON document we just copied then click `Upload`.

(This is exactly like deploying Kubernetes applications and services from the `kubectl` command with `kubectl create -f <file.json>`, only doing it via the UI saves us from having to configure the desktop's local Kubernetes CLI.)

### Thats it!
Kubernetes was already an extremely powerful tool for fast, easy deployment and management of containerised applications. Now with Cisco Container Platform, the complexity and staffing requirements of building out and maintaining the Kubernetes infrastructure itself has been replaced by a provisioning API.
